      Must do before meeting\r\nHey Robin,\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the pdf file with our
      business proposal I mentioned last night. This is our biggest break yet so
      please print toBePrinted.pdf before our meeting today!\r\n\r\nAlso, IT has
      been getting swarmed with tickets ever since that security breach a couple
      of days ago. So you might run into some problems opening some docs. I hope
      that Rachel brought you up to speed with the new troubleshooting procedures.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s
      get this bread!\r\n\r\nDaryl.\r\n"

      Dear
      Sir:

      I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company
      to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National
      Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil
      exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced
      moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous
      of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain
      regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to
      another region.You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist
      the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria,
      in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your
      name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed
      by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating
      services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you
      to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount which is good PAYMENT for your
      troubles. However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according
      to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in
      a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria. If it will
      be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that
      you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce
      you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well
      as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria. Please call me at
      your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter;
      very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is
      maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository
      taxes on it.Yours truly,

      Prince Alyusi Islassis
